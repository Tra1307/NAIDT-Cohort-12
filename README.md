# NAIDT-Cohort-12
In this repo are some assignments, tasks and class codes, covered in the basic python class for cohort 12
The codes are not necessarily arranged into the different days, they're scattered, so please just try and navigate through them.
day8 is zipped in a folder so that you do not have directory issues when trying to excute the code.
