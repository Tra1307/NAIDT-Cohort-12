# [The Python Package Index](https://pypi.org):
is a repository of third-party Python packages that can be
installed and used in Python projects.
pip is a package manager for Python that allows you to easily install, manage, and uninstall
packages from PyPi.
With pip, you can install packages by running pip install <package_name> in the command line.
pip automatically resolves dependencies and installs the required packages.
"""
"""
# Virtual Environments(venv):
A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment that allows you to install packages
separately for different projects.
Virtual environments help avoid conflicts between packages and ensure that each project has its
own set of dependencies.
"""

"""
installation:
pip install virtualenv
python -m venv .venv
or
python -m venv .venv
pip install can now be used after activating the environment
